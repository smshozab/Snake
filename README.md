<h1>Snake Game in C++</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
This Snake game is a console-based implementation in C++. It recreates the classic Snake game where players control a snake to eat food, grow longer, and avoid collisions with the walls and themselves.

<h4>Score Tracking:</h4> The game keeps track of the player's score based on the number of food items eaten.

<h4>Game Over Screen:</h4> Upon game over, the player is presented with a game over screen displaying their final score.
